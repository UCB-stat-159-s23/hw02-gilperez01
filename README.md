This project involved improving an existing repository called the LIGO Gravitational Wave Detection Tutorial Notebook by making it more reproducible. I accomplished this by creating Python files that were more accessible, creating a Conda environment, and uploading the project to a public Binder on GitHub. The new and improved project is now easier to use and can be easily reproduced by others. This project highlights the importance of reproducibility in scientific research and showcases how tools like Conda and Binder can help achieve this goal.
